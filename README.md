# Mastering the Meta: Analyzing Top Hero Picks in Professional Dota 2 Matches  

## Background

This project aims to provide insights into the world of competitive video gaming, specifically in the context of multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) games, with a primary focus on Dota 2. In MOBA games like Dota 2, team composition and hero selection play a crucial role in determining the outcome of matches. The "meta," short for "metagame," refers to the current trends and strategies used by top players and teams. Understanding the meta is vital for players looking to improve their performance in the game.

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to analyze and visualize the best hero picks based on the current meta. By examining data from professional Dota 2 matches, this project aims to answer questions such as:

- Which heroes are highly favored by top players in the current meta?
- Are there any hero combinations that are particularly effective?

The project provides valuable information to Dota 2 players, teams, and enthusiasts who want to make informed decisions when selecting heroes for their matches.

## Data Description
The data used in this project includes:

- Match data from professional Dota 2 tournaments.
- Hero statistics like pick and win rates, and in-game performance metrics.
- Time-series data showing the evolution of hero popularity and effectiveness.

## Methods Used

### Data Collection
The project gathers data from Kaggle. The data includes hero picks, win rates, and match outcomes from professional tournaments and high-level matchmaking games.

### Data Analysis
Python is used for data analysis and manipulation. The project utilizes libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib to process and visualize the data. Statistical techniques are applied to identify trends and correlations among hero picks and match outcomes.

### Visualization

Data visualization is a crucial aspect of the project. Matplotlib and Seaborn are used to create insightful graphs and charts that help users understand the meta trends. These visualizations include hero popularity charts, win rate histograms, and timeline graphs showing meta shifts over time.

## Technology Stack
- Python for data analysis and machine learning.
- Libraries: Pandas for data manipulation, Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization, Scikit-learn for predictive modeling.
- Jupyter Notebook for interactive development and documentation.

## Project Output

The project's results are continuously updated to reflect the ever-evolving meta in Dota 2. Users can find the following information in the project: The hero role with the highest average win rate is Escape, and to have a high chance of winning, one must follow the latest META. To help achieve this goal, we should search for a hero with the Escape role, having the Primary Attribute as All, and a win rate that still ranks within the top 10 highest win rates. These criteria are met by the hero Sand King.

## Project Strengths and Limitations
### Strengths
- Provides current, data-driven insights into the Dota 2 meta.
- Helps players and teams in strategic planning and hero selection.

### Limitations
- Dependent on the availability and quality of match data.
- Analysis might not fully capture sudden shifts in the meta.
